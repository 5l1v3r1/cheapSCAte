# cheapSCAte

Scripts used for performing a CPA attack on IoT-like devices, such as the RHMe2 device.
These scripts are provided as-is, use them at your own risk. You will probably need to modify the scripts as described in the top of each script.
The scripts require python and libsigrok to be executed, as well as the hantek6022be sigrok drivers to be installed.
The CPA attack can be performed with jlSCA , see https://github.com/Riscure/Jlsca
These scripts were used during a live demo in a talk RSA Conference 2018; see https://www.riscure.com/gocheap/ for more information & link to RSA slideset.
